                Where Germany meets Switzerland and Austria is Lake Constance.
                On its northen borther is Konstanz, the city that will hold the
                digital arts conference "xCoAx" in July of 2023. The idea of a
                border, so relevant to this place, was the main idea explored
                here: the intersection between countries, as well as the
                convergence between media, art forms and artists, the
                overlapping between creativity and algorithmic rules, the
                exchange of ideas and the connection to the “X factor” that
                connects the three main elements of this conference:
                computation, communication and aesthetics.
              </p>
              <p id="description-2">
                In order to strengthen xCoAx’s identity and recognizability, we
                believe it’s important to hang on to some key elements, namely
                color and the ever-so-present gradient. That being said, we
                wanted to adapt these elements while simultaneously providing
                the 2023 edition its own individuality. Joining the blue and
                magenta are red and yellow — bright and bold, taking inspiration
                from the RGB spectrum. This decision was based on the
                conference’s very clear connection to digital media and thus all
                sorts of RGB output devices.

                In July of 2022, Coimbra, Portugal served as the host city for
                the xCoAx conference, bringing together participants from around
                the world to share their research, discuss new ideas, and
                showcase innovative digital art projects. Through a series of
                talks, exhibitions and presentations, xCoAx 2022 highlighted the
                importance of interdisciplinary thinking and the role of
                technology in shaping contemporary art and culture.
              </p>
              <p id="description-2">
                xCoAx's visual identity is part of a flexible design system that
                includes variable typography, logo, color palette, patterns, and
                textures. This approach allows for experimentation and a playful
                visual style while maintaining a cohesive and organic graphic
                evolution from year to year. The 2022 edition of the conference
                featured the continuation of the gradient and RGB-inspired color
                scheme in its visual identity. Additionally, we introduced a
                font called
                <a href="https://www.redaction.us/" target="_blank">Redaction</a
                >, which incorporates varying levels of pixelization, serving as
                a reminder of the event's connection to the vast realm of
                digital media.

                The festivity of "Nossa Senhora do Rosário" has been celebrated
                for more than 300 years in Gondomar, Portugal. This October
                celebration is the most important tradition in the town. On the
                first Sunday of the month, Gondomar transforms from a quiet,
                dark, and silent suburb on the outskirts of Porto into a vibrant
                hub of festivity. The "jewels" (jóias) of the Rosário, which are
                bright and colorful lights, fill the black sky and create an
                epicenter of celebration.
              </p>
              <p id="description-2">
                To immortalize and pay homage to this poorly documented
                Portuguese tradition, a photobook was created, which is the
                result of an analog and digital photographic session that took
                place on the night of October 4th, 2019. The photographic
                spreads are repeatedly invaded by loose typography, which
                reinforces the idea of a multisensory experience intrinsic to
                the festivity. The typography also helps to create a narrative
                that is intimately connected to the personal experience of a
                "Gondomarense" who is an avid participant in the celebration.

                  This project seeks to visually represent a shared media
                  ecology within a shared universe, specifically the
                  transitional space between the domestic and academic
                  environments, the journey between home and university. Our
                  goal is to explore how media technologies shape our experience
                  of this transitional space and how they facilitate or inhibit
                  our ability to navigate this space effectively.

                <p id="description-2">
                  To achieve this, we chose to focus on the radio as a starting
                  point for the mapping of our media ecology, as it is a
                  technology that is extremely prevalent on car rides. The
                  concept of white noise associated with the radio is also
                  essential to this project as it represents the constant flow
                  of information that surrounds us during the commute.
                  Ultimately, the project functions as an exploration of how
                  technology shapes our experiences and understanding of the
                  world around us.

                  The EU's handling of migrants and refugees has been a
                  perpetual failure. As European citizens, we are fed a
                  distorted glimpse of their journeys by the media to avoid the
                  risk of encouraging us to empathize and take real action. We
                  can’t accept their truth and must demand accountability and
                  action. This essay serves as a reminder of what is concealed
                  from us.

                <p id="description-2">
                  The scenery depicted in the book was created through our own
                  performance. During the process of crafting this environment,
                  the screen played a prominent role. We captured panoramic
                  shots of a TV screen, resulting in images that emerged from
                  the interplay of two machines. This interaction produced an
                  altered reflection of images from one screen onto another.
                  However, the performative aspect was vital to our essay, as it
                  allows us, the designers, to play an active role. We remain
                  silent to avoid overshadowing the experiences of migrants and
                  refugees, but we are present.
